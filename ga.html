		<h1><span class="bold">MindBrush</span> is an app that promotes mental well-being amongst college students by making aspects of it a daily routine.</h1>
		<h3><br>This app is a result of my final project for a UX class taught through General Assembly. I aimed to find a way to elevate mental hygiene on the level of physical hygiene in college students. After reaching out to some peers with back-end and data science experience, we entered MindBrush into U.Va’s social entrepreneurship competition and won the concept stage (Nov. 2017).</h3>

	<div class="text mb">
		<h3>The problem we are trying to address is that mental illness plagues college campuses. Studies have shown that 75% of lifetime mental illness cases develop by age 24 (Center for College Mental Health Penn State, 2015). Additionally, 41% of college students reported suffering from a mental health issue (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2016); the other 59% aren’t necessarily “safe” as mental health can affect any person like how physical health can affect any one. Due to mental health statistics depending on individuals self-reporting their personal issues, these figures are likely to be an understatement.<br><br>To figure out how student are currently dealing with mental health issues and what problems they actually face, we conducted over 100 interviews with various U.Va. students. Some of the reoccurring pain points are cited below. We also found that only 20% of the people we talked to said they would use a “mental health app," while 100% reported they struggle to make time for people that matter to them in their daily lives. After synthesizing our research, I consolidated all of the pain points we are trying to address into a user persona, Sam; this helped keep users like her in mind during our design and execution process to ensure that we avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.</h3>

			<h3>Sam is stressed from knowing what she wants to do in life. On top of this, she has a hard time balancing academics, friends, and self-care. While she values time with friends, she struggles to see them as often as she would like due to difficulty finding time that works for both parties. If she spends long periods of time alone, which is often the case before midterms when she has the added stress of completing all her responsibilities in addition to studying for exams, she feels more unmotivated to do her work. Her lack of motivation doesn’t help with her procrastination tendencies making her more stressed during midterms, because she has less time to stay on top of her responsibilities. This time crunch further makes it difficult for her to remember and prioritize taking care of her physical and mental health.</h3>

		<h1>Sam needs an easier way to make more time for the people she cares about during her busy college life, because this will help her stay motivated and increase her mood during stressful times like midterms in particular.</h1><br><br>
		<h3>How might we help Sam make more time for her friends every day and take away the frustration of coordinating a time that works for her and her friends' busy schedules?</h3>

	<div class="cap">THE SOLUTION</div>
	<div class="text mb">
		<h3>While there are many “mental health apps” on the market, many of them have low user retention rates as these apps require frequent user input. Further, mental illness is highly stigmatized and most solutions are prescriptive rather than proactive. In other words, these apps are targeted to those who suffer from anxiety, depression or some other “mental illness.” In attempts to reduce this stigma, we opted to use the terminology “mental hygiene” to elevate mental health to be equal to physical health, rather than primarily associating mental health with mental illness. Mental hygiene is anything from basic self-care, such as catching up on sleep or meditating, to spending quality time with loved ones; in short, it is anything needed for an individual to function at his or her best. 
		<br><br>Given that our interviews showed more people are interested in making more time for their friends and that regular face-to-face interaction reduces the risk of depression by 50% (Oregon Health & Science University 2014), we decided the primary feature of MindBrush should be an automatic scheduler that prompts users when they have mutual availability with their friends and then asks if he or she would like the app to send an invitation for them. This takes away the frustration and time consuming aspect of scheduling meetings with friends by doing it for the user and allows them to not have to worry about making time for friends while having more mental energy to stay on top of other responsibilities.
		<br><br>An additional feature we decided to include in this initial step was a trend tracking feature that compares the user’s mental hygiene to other aspects of their life such as sleep, social activity, exercise, etc. We hoped to address another one of Sam’s problems, which was that when she feels down, she often doesn’t know why she does rendering her unable to address the problem directly. 
		Wireframes were made in sketch; prototype was done in InVision and then Adobe XD (free trial for InVision ended, and there was only funding for Adobe CC).</h3>

		<h3>As this project is a work in progress, the process above is only the initial phase of our solution. I have conducted usability tests on these initial wireframe and prototype iterations and plan to conduct more as we build out the other features. The next steps for our group are to finish competing in the U.VA social entrepreneurship competition (discovery and prototype phase) in addition to building out other possible features that promote mental hygiene in college students daily lives.</h3>

		<h3>What I've learned so far is that people are more biased than than think. Sometimes the solution to the problem isn't always as direct as one wants it to be; often, the problem that needs to be solved may not be the problem that one wants to solve. With this in mind, I learned simpler solutions are better. My initial concept consisted of too many features, because I tried to solve all the user's problems at once rather than prioritizing the features. Most importantly, I learned that empathy for the user’s problem is important in devising the most effective solution.</h3>
