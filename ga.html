			<h3>The inspiration for this project came from our interest in addressing the mental illness problem that plagues college campuses. 41% of college students reported suffering from a mental health issue (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2016); the other 59% aren’t necessarily “safe” as mental health can affect any person like how physical health can affect anyone. Since  mental health statistics depend on individuals self-reporting their personal issues, these figures are likely to be an understatement. </h3>

			<h1>MEET KATE<br></h1><h3>Kate is stressed from knowing what she wants to do in life. On top of this, she has a hard time balancing academics, friends, and self-care. While she values time with friends, she struggles to see them as often as she would like due to difficulty finding time that works for both parties. If she spends long periods of time alone, which is often the case before midterms when she has the added stress of completing all her responsibilities in addition to studying for exams, she feels more unmotivated to do her work. Her lack of motivation doesn’t help with her habits of procrastinating making her more stressed during midterms, because she has less time to stay on top of her responsibilities. This time crunch further makes it difficult for her to remember and prioritize taking care of her physical and mental health during busy times of the school year. </h3>

			<h1>Kate needs an easier way to make more time for the people she cares about during her busy college life, because this will help her stay motivated and increase her mood during stressful times like midterms in particular.</h1>

			<h1>SOLUTION<br></h1><h3>Many mental health apps currently have low user retention rates as these apps require frequent user input. Further, mental illness is highly stigmatized and most solutions are prescriptive rather than proactive. These apps are targeted to those who suffer from anxiety, depression or some other “mental illness.” In attempts to reduce this stigma, we opted to use the terminology “mental wellbeing" to elevate how people see mental health, rather than primarily associating the term with mental illness. Mental wellbeing is anything from basic self-care, such as catching up on sleep or meditating, to spending quality time with loved ones; in short, it is anything needed for an individual to function at his or her best. <br><br>Given that our interviews showed more people are interested in making more time for their friends and that regular face-to-face interaction reduces the risk of depression by 50% (Oregon Health & Science University 2014), we decided the primary feature of Mindbrush should be an automatic scheduler that prompts users when they have mutual availability with their friends and then asks if he or she would like the app to send an invitation for them. This takes away the frustration and time consuming aspect of scheduling meetings with friends by doing it for the user and allows them to not have to worry about making time for friends while having more mental energy to stay on top of other responsibilities. </h3>
